Basic DevStack installation
===========================

Most basic DevStack installation of kuryr-kubernetes is pretty simple. This
document aims to be a tutorial through installation steps.

Document assumes using Centos 7 OS, but same steps should apply for other
operating systems. It is also assumed that ``git`` is already installed on the
system. DevStack will make sure to install and configure OpenStack, Kubernetes
and dependencies of both systems.


Cloning required repositories
-----------------------------

First of all you need to clone DevStack:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://opendev.org/openstack-dev/devstack

Create user *stack*, give it required permissions and log in as that user:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ./devstack/tools/create-stack-user.sh
   $ sudo su stack

*stack* user has ``/opt/stack`` set as its home directory. It will need its own
repository with DevStack. Also clone kuryr-kubernetes:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://opendev.org/openstack-dev/devstack
   $ git clone https://opendev.org/openstack/kuryr-kubernetes

Copy sample ``local.conf`` (DevStack configuration file) to devstack
directory:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cp kuryr-kubernetes/devstack/local.conf.sample devstack/local.conf

.. note::

   ``local.conf.sample`` file is configuring Neutron and Kuryr with standard
   Open vSwitch ML2 networking. In the ``devstack`` directory there are other
   sample configuration files that enable OpenDaylight or Drangonflow
   networking. See other pages in this documentation section to learn more.

Now edit ``devstack/local.conf`` to set up some initial options:

* If you have multiple network interfaces, you need to set ``HOST_IP`` variable
  to the IP on the interface you want to use as DevStack's primary.
* ``KURYR_K8S_LBAAS_USE_OCTAVIA`` can be set to False if you want more
  lightweight installation. In that case installation of Glance and Nova will
  be omitted.
* If you already have Docker installed on the machine, you can comment out line
  starting with ``enable_plugin devstack-plugin-container``.

Once ``local.conf`` is configured, you can start the installation:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ./devstack/stack.sh

Installation takes from 15 to 30 minutes. Once that's done you should see
similar output:

.. code-block:: console

   DevStack Version: queens
   Change: 301d4d1678c3c1342abc03e51a74574f7792a58b Merge "Use "pip list" in check_libs_from_git" 2017-10-04 07:22:59 +0000

You can test DevStack by sourcing credentials and trying some commands:

.. code-block:: console

   $ source /devstack/openrc admin admin
   $ openstack service list
   +----------------------------------+------------------+------------------+
   | ID                               | Name             | Type             |
   +----------------------------------+------------------+------------------+
   | 091e3e2813cc4904b74b60c41e8a98b3 | kuryr-kubernetes | kuryr-kubernetes |
   | 2b6076dd5fc04bf180e935f78c12d431 | neutron          | network          |
   | b598216086944714aed2c233123fc22d | keystone         | identity         |
   +----------------------------------+------------------+------------------+

To verify if Kubernetes is running properly, list its nodes and check status of
the only node you should have. The correct value is "Ready":

.. code-block:: console

   $ kubectl get nodes
   NAME        STATUS    AGE       VERSION
   localhost   Ready     2m        v1.6.2

To test kuryr-kubernetes itself try creating a Kubernetes pod:

.. code-block:: console

   $ kubectl run --image busybox test -- sleep 3600
   $ kubectl get pods -o wide
   NAME                    READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE       IP        NODE
   test-3202410914-1dp7g   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          7s        <none>    localhost

After a moment (even up to few minutes as Docker image needs to be downloaded)
you should see that pod got the IP from OpenStack network:

.. code-block:: console

   $ kubectl get pods -o wide
   NAME                    READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP          NODE
   test-3202410914-1dp7g   1/1       Running   0          35s       10.0.0.73   localhost

You can verify that this IP is really assigned to Neutron port:

.. code-block:: console

   [stack@localhost kuryr-kubernetes]$ openstack port list | grep 10.0.0.73
   | 3ce7fd13-ad0a-4e92-9b6f-0d38d50b1699 |     | fa:16:3e:8e:f4:30 | ip_address='10.0.0.73', subnet_id='ddfbc8e9-68da-48f9-8a05-238ea0607e0d' | ACTIVE |

If those steps were successful, then it looks like your DevStack with
kuryr-kubernetes is working correctly. In case of errors, copy last ~50 lines
of the logs, paste them into `paste.openstack.org`_ and ask other developers
for help on `Kuryr's IRC channel`_. More info on how to use DevStack can be
found in `DevStack Documentation`_, especially in section `Using Systemd in
DevStack`_, which explains how to use ``systemctl`` to control services and
``journalctl`` to read its logs.
