How to try out nested-pods locally (VLAN + trunk)
=================================================

Following are the instructions for an all-in-one setup where Kubernetes will
also be running inside the same Nova VM in which Kuryr-controller and Kuryr-cni
will be running. 4GB memory and 2 vCPUs, is the minimum resource requirement
for the VM:

#. To install OpenStack services run devstack with
   ``devstack/local.conf.pod-in-vm.undercloud.sample``. Ensure that "trunk"
   service plugin is enabled in ``/etc/neutron/neutron.conf``:

   .. code-block:: ini

      [DEFAULT]
      service_plugins = neutron.services.l3_router.l3_router_plugin.L3RouterPlugin,neutron.services.trunk.plugin.TrunkPlugin

#. Launch a VM with `Neutron trunk port`_. The next steps can be followed:
   `Boot VM with a Trunk Port`_.

#. Inside VM, install and setup Kubernetes along with Kuryr using devstack:

   - Since undercloud Neutron will be used by pods, Neutron services should be
     disabled in localrc.
   - Run devstack with ``devstack/local.conf.pod-in-vm.overcloud.sample``.
     But first fill in the needed information:

     - Point to the undercloud deployment by setting:

          .. code-block:: bash

             SERVICE_HOST=UNDERCLOUD_CONTROLLER_IP

     - Fill in the subnetpool id of the undercloud deployment, as well as the
       router where the new pod and service networks need to be connected:

          .. code-block:: bash

             KURYR_NEUTRON_DEFAULT_SUBNETPOOL_ID=UNDERCLOUD_SUBNETPOOL_V4_ID
             KURYR_NEUTRON_DEFAULT_ROUTER=router1

     - Ensure the nested-vlan driver is going to be set by setting:

          .. code-block:: bash

             KURYR_POD_VIF_DRIVER=nested-vlan

     - Optionally, the ports pool funcionality can be enabled by following:
       `How to enable ports pool with devstack`_.

     - [OPTIONAL] If you want to enable the subport pools driver and the VIF
       Pool Manager you need to include:

          .. code-block:: bash

             KURYR_VIF_POOL_MANAGER=True

#. Once devstack is done and all services are up inside VM. Next steps are to
   configure the missing information at ``/etc/kuryr/kuryr.conf``:

   - Configure worker VMs subnet:

      .. code-block:: ini

         [pod_vif_nested]
         worker_nodes_subnet = <UNDERCLOUD_SUBNET_WORKER_NODES_UUID>

   - Configure binding section:

      .. code-block:: ini

         [binding]
         driver = kuryr.lib.binding.drivers.vlan
         link_iface = <VM interface name eg. eth0>

   - Restart kuryr-k8s-controller:

      .. code-block:: console

         $ sudo systemctl restart devstack@kuryr-kubernetes.service

   - Restart kuryr-daemon:

      .. code-block:: console

         $ sudo systemctl restart devstack@kuryr-daemon.service

Now launch pods using kubectl, Undercloud Neutron will serve the networking.
