=========================================
Kuryr Kubernetes OpenDayLight Integration
=========================================

OpenDaylight is a highly available, modular, extensible, scalable and
multi-protocol controller infrastructure built for SDN deployments on modern
heterogeneous multi-vendor networks.

OpenStack can use OpenDaylight as its network management provider through the
Modular Layer 2 (ML2) north-bound plug-in. OpenDaylight manages the network
flows for the OpenStack compute nodes via the OVSDB south-bound plug-in.

Integrating these allows Kuryr to be used to bridge (both baremetal and
nested) containers and VM networking in a OpenDaylight-based OpenStack
deployment. Kuryr acts as the container networking interface for OpenDaylight.


Testing with DevStack
---------------------

The next points describe how to test OpenStack with ODL using DevStack.
We will start by describing how to test the baremetal case on a single host,
and then cover a nested environment where containers are created inside VMs.


Single Node Test Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Create a test system.

It's best to use a throwaway dev system for running DevStack. Your best bet is
to use either CentOS 7 or the latest Ubuntu LTS (16.04, Xenial).

#. Create the ``stack`` user.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ git clone https://opendev.org/openstack-dev/devstack.git
      $ sudo ./devstack/tools/create-stack-user.sh

#. Switch to the ``stack`` user and clone DevStack and kuryr-kubernetes.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ sudo su - stack
      $ git clone https://opendev.org/openstack-dev/devstack.git
      $ git clone https://opendev.org/openstack/kuryr-kubernetes.git

#. Configure DevStack to use ODL.

   kuryr-kubernetes comes with a sample DevStack configuration file for ODL you
   can start with. For example, you may want to set some values for the various
   PASSWORD variables in that file, or change the LBaaS service provider to
   use. Feel free to edit it if you'd like, but it should work as-is.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ cd devstack
      $ cp ../kuryr-kubernetes/devstack/local.conf.odl.sample local.conf

   Optionally, the ports pool functionality can be enabled by following:
   `How to enable ports pool with devstack`_.

#. Run DevStack.

   This is going to take a while. It installs a bunch of packages, clones a
   bunch of git repos, and installs everything from these git repos.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ ./stack.sh

   Once DevStack completes successfully, you should see output that looks
   something like this:

   .. code-block:: console

      This is your host IP address: 192.168.5.10
      This is your host IPv6 address: ::1
      Keystone is serving at http://192.168.5.10/identity/
      The default users are: admin and demo
      The password: pass

#. Extra configurations.

   Devstack does not wire up the public network by default so we must do some
   extra steps for floating IP usage as well as external connectivity:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ sudo ip link set br-ex up
      $ sudo ip route add 172.24.4.0/24 dev br-ex
      $ sudo ip addr add 172.24.4.1/24 dev br-ex

   Then you can create forwarding and NAT rules that will cause "external"
   traffic from your instances to get rewritten to your network controller's ip
   address and sent out on the network:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ sudo iptables -A FORWARD -d 172.24.4.0/24 -j ACCEPT
      $ sudo iptables -A FORWARD -s 172.24.4.0/24 -j ACCEPT
      $ sudo iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING 1 -s 172.24.4.1/24 -j MASQUERADE


Inspect default Configuration
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In order to check the default configuration, in term of networks, subnets,
security groups and loadbalancers created upon a successful devstack stacking,
you can check the `Inspect default Configuration`_.


Testing Network Connectivity
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Once the environment is ready, we can test that network connectivity works
among pods. To do that check out `Testing Network Connectivity`_.


Nested Containers Test Environment (VLAN)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another deployment option is the nested-vlan where containers are created
inside OpenStack VMs by using the Trunk ports support. Thus, first we need to
deploy an undercloud devstack environment with the needed components to
create VMs (e.g., Glance, Nova, Neutron, Keystone, ...), as well as the needed
ODL configurations such as enabling the trunk support that will be needed for
the VM. And then install the overcloud deployment inside the VM with the kuryr
components.


Undercloud deployment
+++++++++++++++++++++

The steps to deploy the undercloud environment are the same described above
for the `Single Node Test Environment` with the different of the sample
local.conf to use (step 4), in this case:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd devstack
   $ cp ../kuryr-kubernetes/devstack/local.conf.pod-in-vm.undercloud.odl.sample local.conf

The main differences with the default odl local.conf sample are that:

- There is no need to enable the kuryr-kubernetes plugin as this will be
  installed inside the VM (overcloud).
- There is no need to enable the kuryr related services as they will also be
  installed inside the VM: kuryr-kubernetes, kubelet, kubernetes-api,
  kubernetes-controller-manager, kubernetes-scheduler and kubelet.
- Nova and Glance components need to be enabled to be able to create the VM
  where we will install the overcloud.
- ODL Trunk service plugin need to be enable to ensure Trunk ports support.

Once the undercloud deployment has finished, the next steps are related to
create the overcloud VM by using a parent port of a Trunk so that containers
can be created inside with their own networks. To do that we follow the next
steps detailed at `Boot VM with a Trunk Port`_.


Overcloud deployment
++++++++++++++++++++

Once the VM is up and running, we can start with the overcloud configuration.
The steps to perform are the same as without ODL integration, i.e., the same
steps as for ML2/OVS:

#. Log in into the VM:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ ssh -i id_rsa_demo centos@FLOATING_IP

#. Deploy devstack following steps 3 and 4 detailed at
   `How to try out nested-pods locally (VLAN + trunk)`_.


Testing Nested Network Connectivity
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Similarly to the baremetal testing, we can create a demo deployment at the
overcloud VM, scale it to any number of pods and expose the service to check if
the deployment was successful. To do that check out
`Testing Nested Network Connectivity`_.
