How to configure SR-IOV ports
=============================

Current approach of SR-IOV relies on `sriov-device-plugin`_. While creating
pods with SR-IOV, sriov-device-plugin should be turned on on all nodes. To use
a SR-IOV port on a baremetal installation the 3 following steps should be done:

#. Create OpenStack network and subnet for SR-IOV. Following steps should be
   done with admin rights.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ neutron net-create vlan-sriov-net --shared --provider:physical_network physnet10_4 --provider:network_type vlan --provider:segmentation_id 3501
      $ neutron subnet-create vlan-sriov-net 203.0.114.0/24 --name vlan-sriov-subnet --gateway 203.0.114.1

   Subnet id <UUID of vlan-sriov-net> will be used later in NetworkAttachmentDefinition.

#. Add sriov section into kuryr.conf.

   .. code-block:: ini

      [sriov]
      default_physnet_subnets = physnet1:<UUID of vlan-sriov-net>

   This mapping is required for ability to find appropriate PF/VF functions at
   binding phase. physnet1 is just an identifier for subnet <UUID of
   vlan-sriov-net>. Such kind of transition is necessary to support
   many-to-many relation.

#. Prepare NetworkAttachmentDefinition object. Apply
   NetworkAttachmentDefinition with "sriov" driverType inside, as described in
   `NPWG spec`_.

   .. code-block:: yaml

      apiVersion: "k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1"
      kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
      metadata:
          name: "sriov-net1"
          annotations:
              openstack.org/kuryr-config: '{
              "subnetId": "UUID of vlan-sriov-net",
              "driverType": "sriov"
              }'


   Then add k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks and request/limits for SR-IOV into the
   pod's yaml.

   .. code-block:: yaml

      kind: Pod
      metadata:
        name: my-pod
        namespace: my-namespace
        annotations:
          k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: sriov-net1,sriov-net2
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: containerName
          image: containerImage
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          command: ["tail", "-f", "/dev/null"]
          resources:
            requests:
              intel.com/sriov: '2'
            limits:
              intel.com/sriov: '2'

   In the above example two SR-IOV devices will be attached to pod. First one
   is described in sriov-net1 NetworkAttachmentDefinition, second one in
   sriov-net2. They may have different subnetId.

#. Specify resource names

   The resource name *intel.com/sriov*, which used in the above example is the
   default resource name. This name was used in SR-IOV network device plugin in
   version 1 (release-v1 branch). But since latest version the device plugin
   can use any arbitrary name of the resources (see `SRIOV network device
   plugin for Kubernetes`_). This name should match "^\[a-zA-Z0-9\_\]+$"
   regular expression. To be able to work with arbitrary resource names
   physnet_resource_mappings and device_plugin_resource_prefix in [sriov]
   section of kuryr-controller configuration file should be filled.  The
   default value for device_plugin_resource_prefix is intel.com, the same as in
   SR-IOV network device plugin, in case of SR-IOV network device plugin was
   started with value of -resource-prefix option different from intel.com, than
   value should be set to device_plugin_resource_prefix, otherwise
   kuryr-kubernetes will not work with resource.

   Assume we have following SR-IOV network device plugin (defined by
   -config-file option)

   .. code-block:: json

      {
          "resourceList":
              [
                 {
                    "resourceName": "numa0",
                    "rootDevices": ["0000:02:00.0"],
                    "sriovMode": true,
                    "deviceType": "netdevice"
                 }
              ]
      }

   We defined numa0 resource name, also assume we started sriovdp with
   -resource-prefix samsung.com value. The PCI address of ens4f0 interface is
   "0000:02:00.0". If we assigned 8 VF to ens4f0 and launch SR-IOV network
   device plugin, we can see following state of kubernetes

   .. code-block:: console

      $ kubectl get node node1 -o json | jq '.status.allocatable'
      {
        "cpu": "4",
        "ephemeral-storage": "269986638772",
        "hugepages-1Gi": "8Gi",
        "hugepages-2Mi": "0Gi",
        "samsung.com/numa0": "8",
        "memory": "7880620Ki",
        "pods": "1k"
      }

   We have to add to the sriov section following mapping:

   .. code-block:: ini

      [sriov]
      device_plugin_resource_prefix = samsung.com
      physnet_resource_mappings = physnet1:numa0

#. Enable Kubelet Pod Resources feature

   To use SR-IOV functionality properly it is necessary to enable Kubelet Pod
   Resources feature. Pod Resources is a service provided by Kubelet via gRPC
   server that allows to request list of resources allocated for each pod and
   container on the node. These resources are devices allocated by k8s device
   plugins. Service was implemented mainly for monitoring purposes, but it also
   suitable for SR-IOV binding driver allowing it to know which VF was
   allocated for particular container.

   To enable Pod Resources service it is needed to add ``--feature-gates
   KubeletPodResources=true`` into ``/etc/sysconfig/kubelet``. This file could
   look like:

   .. code-block:: bash

      KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS="--feature-gates KubeletPodResources=true"

   Note that it is important to set right value for parameter
   ``kubelet_root_dir`` in ``kuryr.conf``. By default it is
   ``/var/lib/kubelet``.  In case of using containerized CNI it is necessary to
   mount ``'kubelet_root_dir'/pod-resources`` directory into CNI container.

   To use this feature add ``enable_pod_resource_service`` into kuryr.conf.

   .. code-block:: ini

      [sriov]
      enable_pod_resource_service = True

#. Use privileged user

   To make neutron ports active kuryr-k8s makes requests to neutron API to
   update ports with binding:profile information. Due to this it is necessary
   to make actions with privileged user with admin rights.
