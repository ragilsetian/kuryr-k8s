    An OpenShift route is a way to expose a service by giving it an
    externally-reachable hostname like www.example.com.
    A defined route and the endpoints identified by its service can be
    consumed by a router to provide named connectivity that allows external
    clients to reach your applications.
    Each route consists of a route name , target service details.
    To enable it the following handlers should be added :

    .. code-block:: ini

      [kubernetes]
      enabled_handlers=vif,lb,lbaasspec,ingresslb,ocproute
