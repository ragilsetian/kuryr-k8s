    Adds a new multi pool driver to support hybrid environments where some
    nodes are Bare Metal while others are running inside VMs, therefore
    having different VIF drivers (e.g., neutron and nested-vlan)

    This new multi pool driver is the default pool driver used even if a
    different vif_pool_driver is set at the config option. However if the
    configuration about the mappings between the different pools and pod vif
    drivers is not provided at the pools_vif_drivers config option of vif_pool
    configuration section only one pool driver will be loaded -- using the
    standard vif_pool_driver and pod_vif_driver config options, i.e., using
    the one selected at kuryr.conf options.

    To enable the option of having different pools depending on the node's pod
    vif types, you need to state the type of pool that you want for each pod
    vif driver, e.g.:

    .. code-block:: ini

      [vif_pool]
      pools_vif_drivers=nested:nested-vlan,neutron:neutron-vif


    This will use a pool driver nested to handle the pods whose vif driver is
    nested-vlan, and a pool driver neutron to handle the pods whose vif driver
    is neutron-vif. When the controller is requesting a vif for a pod in
    node X, it will first read the node's annotation about pod_vif driver to
    use, e.g., pod_vif: nested-vlan, and then use the corresponding pool
    driver -- which has the right pod-vif driver set.

    Note that if no annotation is set on a node, the default pod_vif_driver
    is used.
