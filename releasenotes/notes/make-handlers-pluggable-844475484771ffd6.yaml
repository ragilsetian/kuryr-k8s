    Introduced a pluggable interface for the Kuryr controller handlers.
    Each Controller handler associates itself with specific Kubernetes
    object kind and is expected to process the events of the watched
    Kubernetes API endpoints.
    The pluggable handlers framework enable both using externally provided
    handlers in Kuryr Controller and controlling which handlers
    should be active.

    To control which Kuryr Controller handlers should be active, the selected
    handlers need to be included at the kuryr.conf at the 'kubernetes'
    section.
    If not specified, Kuryr Controller will run the default handlers.
    For example, to enable only the 'vif' controller handler we should set
    the following at kuryr.conf:

    .. code-block:: ini

      [kubernetes]
      enabled_handlers=vif
