    oslo.cache support has been added to the default_subnet driver. This
    allows to skip unnecessary calls to neutron to retrieve network and
    subnet information that can be cached and retrieved faster. It includes
    the generic oslo caching options to enable/disable it as well as to
    specify the backend to use (dogpile.cache.memory by default). In addition
    it includes the specific options ofr the subnet driver, to enable/disable
    it just for this driver, as well as to specify the cache time. To change
    default configurations, the next can be modified at kuryr.conf

    .. code-block:: ini

      [cache]
      enable=True
      backend=dogpile.cache.memory

      [subnet_caching]
      caching=True
      cache_time=3600
