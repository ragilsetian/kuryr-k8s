    kuryr-daemon used to listen on port 50036, but that's a port from local
    range (on Ubuntu and RHEL default range is 32768-60999). This means that
    there might have been a port conflict ("address already in use"). To avoid
    that the default value of ``[cni_daemon]bind_address`` option was changed
    to ``127.0.0.1:5036``.
