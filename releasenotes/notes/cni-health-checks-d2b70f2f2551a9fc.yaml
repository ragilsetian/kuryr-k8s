    The CNI daemon now provides health checks allowing the deployer or the
    orchestration layer to probe it for readiness and liveness.

    These health checks are served and executed by a Manager that runs
    as part of CNI daemon, and offers two endpoints indicating whether
    it is ready and alive.

    The Manager validates presence of NET_ADMIN capabilities, health status
    of a transactional database, connectivity with Kubernetes API, quantity of
    CNI add failures, health of CNI components and amount of memory
    being consumed. The health checks fails if any of the presented checks
    are not validated, causing the orchestration layer to restart.
    More information can be found in the kuryr-kubernetes documentation.
