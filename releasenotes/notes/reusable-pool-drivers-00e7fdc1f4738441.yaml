features:
  - |
    It is now possible to use same pool_driver for different pod_vif_drivers
    when using MultiVIFPool driver.

    A new config option `vif_pool.vif_pool_mapping` is introduced which is a
    dict/mapping from pod_vif_driver => pool_driver. So different
    pod_vif_drivers can be configured to use the same pool_driver.

    .. code-block:: ini

      [vif_pool]
      vif_pool_mapping=nested-vlan:nested,neutron-vif:neutron

    Earlier each instance of a pool_driver was mapped to a single
    pod_driver, thus requiring a unique pool_driver for each pod_vif_driver.
upgrade:
  - |
    If ``vif_pool.pools_vif_drivers`` config option is used, new config option
    `vif_pool.vif_pool_mapping` should be populated with inverted mapping
    from the present value of ``vif_pool.pools_vif_drivers``.
deprecations:
  - |
    Configuration option ``vif_pool.pools_vif_drivers`` has been deprecated in
    favour of ``vif_pool.vif_pool_mapping`` to allow reuse of pool_drivers for
    different pod_vif_drivers.

    If ``vif_pool_mapping`` is not configured, ``pools_vif_drivers`` will still
    continue to work for now, but ``pools_vif_drivers`` will be completely
    removed in a future release.
