    Introduced a new subnet driver that is able to create a new subnet
    (including the network and its connection to the router) for each
    namespace creation event.

    To enable it the namespace subnet driver must be selected and the
    namespace handler needs to be enabled:

    .. code-block:: ini

      [kubernetes]
      enabled_handlers=vif,lb,lbaasspec,namespace
      pod_subnets_driver = namespace
