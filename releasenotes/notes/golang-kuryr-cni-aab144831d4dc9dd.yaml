features:

    kuryr-cni, that is the executable called by kubelet, is now rewritten to
    golang. This enables Kuryr to work containerized in environments where
    there is no Python or curl on the hosts running kubelet. This is the case
    e.g. in K8s deployed by Magnum.
upgrade:
  - |
    kuryr-cni is now a golang binary. The upgrade should be automatic and
    consists of deploying an updated kuryr-cni container. Please note that if
    you used a custom listening port for kuryr-daemon, it is currently
    hardcoded to 5036. We're planning to pass it through 10-kuryr.conf CNI
    configuration file in the very near future.
