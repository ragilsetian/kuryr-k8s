   For the external services (type=LoadBalancer) case,
   a new field 'external_svc_net' was added and the 'external_svc_subnet'
   field become optional.
   The following should be modified at kuryr.conf::


         [neutron_defaults]
         external_svc_net= <id of external network>
         # 'external_svc_subnet' field is optional, set this field in case
         # multiple subnets attached to 'external_svc_net'
         external_svc_subnet= <id of external subnet>

    It is very common for production environments to only allow access
    to the public network and not the associated public subnets.
    In that case, we fail to allocate a floating IP to the Loadbalancer service
    type.
    In order to fix it, we added an option for specifying the network id instead
    and switch the subnet config option to being optional.
