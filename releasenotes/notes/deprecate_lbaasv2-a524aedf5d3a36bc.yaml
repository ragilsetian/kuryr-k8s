upgrade:
  - |
    Legacy Kuryr deployment relying on neutron-lbaas as the LBaaSv2 endpoint is
    now deprecated. The possibility of using it as Kuryr's lbaasv2 endpoint
    will be totally removed in one of the next releases.
deprecations:
  - |
    Running Kuryr-Kubernetes with neutron-lbaasv2 is now deprecated. The main
    motivation for this is the deprecation of the neutron-lbaas implementation
    in favour to Octavia.

    Possibility of running Kuryr-Kubernetes with the lbaas handler pointing to
    anything but Octavia or SDN lbaas implementations will be removed in
    future releases.
