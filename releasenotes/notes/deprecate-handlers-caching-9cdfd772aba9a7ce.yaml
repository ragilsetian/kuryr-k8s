deprecations:
  - |
    Configuration sections ``[namespace_handler_caching]``,  ``[np_handler_caching]``
    and ``[vif_handler_caching]`` have been deprecated due to simplifying quota usage
    calculation for readiness checks. Instead of counting Neutron objects
    (ports, sg, subnets, and networks), the quota_details extension is used,
    which includes used, limit and reserved counts per resource.
    In this way, caching becomes unnecessary.
