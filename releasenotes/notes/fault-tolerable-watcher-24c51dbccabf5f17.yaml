   For the kuryr kubernetes watcher,
   a new option 'watch_retry_timeout' has been added.
   The following should be modified at kuryr.conf::


         [kubernetes]
         # 'watch_retry_timeout' field is optional,
         # default = 60 if not set.
         watch_retry_timeout = <Time in seconds>

    K8s api server is often temporarily down and restored soon in production
    environment. Since kuryr-kubernetes watches k8s resources by connecting
    k8s api server, watcher fails to watch the resources if k8s api server is
    down.
    In order to fix it, we made watcher retry connecting to k8s api server for
    specific time duration when an exception is raised.
