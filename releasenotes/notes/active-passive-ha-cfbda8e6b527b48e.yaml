    Kuryr-Kubernetes now supports running kuryr-controller service in
    **Active/Passive HA mode**. This is only possible when running those services
    as Pods on Kubernetes cluster, as Kubernetes is used for leader election.
    Also it is required to add leader-elector container to the kuryr-controller
    Pods. HA is controlled by ``[kubernetes]controller_ha`` option, which
    defaults to ``False``.
