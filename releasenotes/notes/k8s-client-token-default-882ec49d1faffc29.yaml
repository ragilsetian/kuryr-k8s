    In order to prioritize running kuryr-kubernetes services as pods on the
    Kubernetes cluster they are supposed to serve, default values of
    ``[kubernetes]ssl_ca_crt_file`` and ``[kubernetes]token_file`` are now
    set to where Kubernetes pods are having those files mounted
    (``/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt`` and
    ``/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token``). This means that
    if you want to run Kuryr services standalone through unauthenticated
    K8s endpoint you need to set both of them to ``""`` in ``kuryr.conf``.
