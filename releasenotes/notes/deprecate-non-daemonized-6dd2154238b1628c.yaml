upgrade:
  - |
    Legacy Kuryr deployment without running kuryr-daemon is now considered
    deprecated. That possibility will be completely removed in one of the next
    releases. Please note that this means that ``[cni_daemon]daemon_enabled``
    option will default to ``True``.
deprecations:
  - |
    Running Kuryr-Kubernetes without kuryr-daemon service is now deprecated.
    Motivations for that move include:

    * Discoveries of bugs that are much easier to fix in kuryr-daemon.
    * Further improvements in Kuryr scalability (e.g. moving choosing VIF from
      pool into kuryr-daemon) are only possible when kuryr-daemon is present.

    Possibility of running Kuryr-Kubernetes without kuryr-daemon will be
    removed in one of the future releases.
