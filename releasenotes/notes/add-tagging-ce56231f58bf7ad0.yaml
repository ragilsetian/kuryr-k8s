    Added possibility to ensure all OpenStack resources created by Kuryr are
    tagged. In case of Neutron regular ``tags`` field is used. If Octavia
    supports tagging (from Octavia API 2.5, i.e. Stein), ``tags`` field is used
    as well, otherwise tags are put on ``description`` field. All this is
    controlled by ``[neutron_defaults]resource_tags`` config option that can
    hold a list of tags to be put on resources. This feature is useful to
    correctly identify any leftovers in OpenStack after K8s cluster Kuryr was
    serving gets deleted.
