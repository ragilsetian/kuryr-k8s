    Introduced kuryr-daemon service. Daemon is an optional service that should
    run on every Kubernetes node. It is responsible for watching pod events on
    the node itâ€™s running on, answering calls from CNI Driver and attaching
    VIFs when they are ready. This helps to limit the number of processes
    spawned when creating multiple Pods, as a single Watcher is enough for each
    node and CNI Driver will only wait on local network socket for response
    from the Daemon.
